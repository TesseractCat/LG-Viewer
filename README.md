A simple viewer for the [Looking Glass Portrait](https://lookingglassfactory.com/portrait) built in [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/index.html).

It doesn't require the HoloPlay software, or a USB-C connection, however you
must fill out the display.cfg file with the correct values, contained in the
visual.json file on the Looking Glass's external storage.
