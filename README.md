# LG Viewer

A simple viewer for the [Looking Glass Portrait](https://lookingglassfactory.com/portrait) built in [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/index.html).

It doesn't require the HoloPlay software, or a USB-C connection, however you
must fill out the display.cfg file with the correct values, contained in the
visual.json file on the Looking Glass's external storage.

## Usage

Simply fill out display.cfg with the values for your looking glass.

Drag the program window to the Looking Glass 'display' and press 'f'. Drag and
drop png/jpg/jpeg quilts to view.

Quilt file names must end in "qsAxB.png/jpg/jpeg" for the tiling to be correct,
where A and B are columns and rows, respectively.
